      Cotton is one of the world’s most important natural fibers, widely used in the textile industry. Its production
      involves several stages, from planting and harvesting to ginning and processing.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The United States is one of the world’s largest cotton producers, primarily in states like Texas, Georgia, and
        Mississippi.</li>
      <li>U.S. cotton is mostly grown in the southern region known as the Cotton Belt.</li>
      <li>Modern U.S. cotton farming uses advanced machinery for planting and harvesting.</li>
      <li>After harvesting, cotton is ginned to separate fibers from seeds before being processed into textiles.</li>
      <li>The U.S. exports a significant portion of its cotton crop to countries around the world.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Upland Cotton vs. Pima Cotton</h2>
    <p>
      In the United States, two main types of cotton are grown: <strong>Upland cotton</strong> and <strong>Pima
        cotton</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Upland Cotton</strong> (Gossypium hirsutum): This is the most widely grown type of cotton in the U.S.,
        accounting for about 95% of production. Upland cotton has medium-length fibers and is used for most everyday
        cotton products, such as denim, t-shirts, and towels.</li>
      <li><strong>Pima Cotton</strong> (Gossypium barbadense): Pima cotton has extra-long staple fibers, making it
        softer, stronger, and more durable than upland cotton. It is used for high-quality textiles like luxury sheets
        and premium clothing. Pima cotton is mainly grown in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Environmental Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cotton farming can be water-intensive and may involve the use of pesticides and fertilizers.</li>
      <li>Sustainable cotton initiatives promote better farming practices to reduce environmental impact.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Cotton remains a vital crop for the global economy and textile industry, with ongoing efforts to improve its
      sustainability.
